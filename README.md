# javascript-everywhere

In an attempt to get my head around function programming and data structures -- on my way from trying to find non class-based examples of graphs in JS -- I went down [this rabbit hole](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3388303/javascript-memoization-handy-functional-programming.html).

Through the first two examples (memoization, mentioned above, and [higher order functions](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3389361/javascript-tutorial-higher-order-functions.html)) and it's a bit clunky. The author doesn't give the greatest examples, for instance.

Ok, some interesting examples in the third part on [data structures](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3392877/functional-javascript-building-data-structures-from-functions.html?upd=1636394244487), but the whole thing was "If you like JavaScript, you'll _love_ [Lisp](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)!", which, no. But definitely some food for thought.
